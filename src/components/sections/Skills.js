						<h4>Front-End Development</h4>
						<p>I like to build code from scratch and explore unique solutions to front-end development problems.</p>
                
<p>I have experience with JavaScript development: bootstraping, refactoring, improving the structure, reliability, and build setup.</p>
<p>I have utlized full integration of front-end development using tools like Webpack with features like automatic code reload, code minifications, multiple environments support, CI/CD, automated testing of accessibility, server-side render and visual snapshots</p>

						<h4 id="designHeader">Designer</h4>
						<p>I approach design problems with curiousity, and I value simple content structure and clean design patterns. I am skilled in creating responsive visual interface designs with visual hierarchy, typography, color theory, animation, and accessibility.</p>
						<h5>Things I enjoy designing:</h5>
						<p>UI, UX, Web, Mobile, Apps, Logos</p>
						<h5>Design Tools:</h5>

						<h4>Back-End Development</h4>
						<p> Due to my passion for design and user accessibility, I was surprised at how much I enjoy working on the back-end.</p>
                        <p> Fullstack Academy uses Javascript as the main language for teaching. With my now strong knowledge I am able to build applications from start to finish.</p>
                        <p> That connection between front and back-end technologies is where the magic happens and I enjoy being apart of that process.</p>
